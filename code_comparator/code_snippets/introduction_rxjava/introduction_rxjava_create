//RxJava is built around observables and observers.
//An onbservable is an object. The state of the observable can be notified to an observer.
//Typically the observer subscribes to the observable which emits items to the observer.

//An Observable is created using operators such as just, fromArray and create

Observable<String> observable = Observable.just("Hello");

//The observer subscribes to the observable using subscribe
observable.subscribe(System.out::println);

//To create an observable taking an array as its data source, we may use the operator fromArray.
String[] strings = {"1", "2", "3", "4", "5"};

Observable.fromArray(strings).
subscribe(System.out::println);

//To create an observable from an iterable data source we may use fromIterable



//To create an Observable from a function we may use the operator create

Observable<String> createObserver = Observable.create(emitter ->
{
    emitter.onNext("Hello World");
    emitter.onComplete();
});

createObserver.subscribe(System.out::println);
