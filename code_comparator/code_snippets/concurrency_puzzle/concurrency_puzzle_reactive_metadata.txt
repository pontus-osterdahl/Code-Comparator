You are given two matrices in the form of two-dimensional ArrayLists (arr_a and arr_b).
The program should multiply these matrice in several threads and merge the results into one matrix.
The current program does not print a result. Locate and correct the error.

- RxJava Operators
The program makes use of several RxJava operators, `range(a,b)` emits b incrementing values beginning with a.
`concatMap`is similat to flatmap but emits sequentially according to when its data sources arrive (this is not guaranteed for flatMap).

- Thread.sleep(ms)
Forces Thread to wait for other threads for ms milliseconds. In simple programs it will be necessary to wait for all threads to finish.
