(R2)

Program uses classes *URL* and *URLConnection* and 

- URL represents a Uniform Resource Locator

- URLConnection represents a communications link between the application and a URL

Program also makes use of the RxJava operator `retry` which retries an operation in case of error for the number of times given as argument.

Program should attempt to connect to a non-existent URL 5 times. If correct, text "Requesting..." should be printed 5 times.
