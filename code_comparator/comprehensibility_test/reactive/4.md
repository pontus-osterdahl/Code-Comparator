(R4)

You are given two matrices in the form of two-dimensional ArrayLists (MATRIX_A, MATRIX_B).
The program should multiply these matrices in *several threads* and merge the results into one matrix.
The multiplication is done in the method `multiplyRow(int row, ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>> a, ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>> b)`. This method prints the thread upon which it is run.
In its present form, the calculation is only performed on one thread, it should however be performed on several threads.

- RxJava Operators
The program makes use of several RxJava operators, `range(a,b)` emits b incrementing values beginning with a.
`concatMap`is similar to flatmap but emits sequentially according to when its data sources arrive (this is not guaranteed for flatMap).

- `subscribeOn` specifies the Scheduler to handle what on what threads the observable is subscribed to. It affects the whole observable and works upstream and downstream.

- `Thread.sleep()` Forces Thread to wait for other threads for ms milliseconds. In simple programs it will be necessary to wait for all threads to finish.
