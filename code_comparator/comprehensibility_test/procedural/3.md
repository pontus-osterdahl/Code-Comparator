(P3)

Program uses classes `File`, `FileReader` and `BufferedReader` to read lines from a file.

The `split()` method splits a String around the delimiting regular expression passed to it. 

- The correct program should print the sum of the content of the file as integers.

- File consists of lines on form 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10

- Sum should be 605
