## Observables and Observers

RxJava is built around *Observables* and *Observers*.

An Observable is an object, which emits items. An Observer consumes these items.

### Creating Observables

- `create` creates an Observable from a function

- `just` creates an observable emitting a simple value

- `fromArray` creates an Observable taking an array as its data source

- `fromIterable` creates an Observable from an iterable data source 

### Subscribing to Observable

An Observable's emissions are received via subscription using `subscribe`.
