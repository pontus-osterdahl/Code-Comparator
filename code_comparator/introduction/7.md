## Schedulers

RxJava uses *Schedulers* to handle multi-threading.
The choice of the Scheduler will affect how many threads are used, how and when.
The Scheduler used in this introduction is *Schedulers.computation* It defines the number of threads allowed to run in parallel from the available 

We use a Scheduler by passing it to the methods `subscribeOn` or `observeOn`.

- `subscribeOn` influences the thread where the observable is subscribed to. It affects the whole observable and works upstream and downstream

- `observeOn` influences the thread which the Observable will use below the point where it is called.
