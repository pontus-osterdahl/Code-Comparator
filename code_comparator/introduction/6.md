## Operators

Values emitted by an Observable can be passed on to *Operators* which in turn emits values.
It is possible and common to *chain* Operators.
Several categories of Operators exist. A selection of types of operators follow below.

### Transforming operators

Operators that transform Observables into new Observables.

`Map` applies a function to each emitted item and passes on result.

`FlatMap` transforms the items emitted by an Observable into Observables and then flattens the emissions from those into a single Observable.

`Scan` applies a function to each item emitted by an Observable sequentially and passes on all successive values.

`Reduce` applies a function to each item emitted by an Observable sequentially but passes on only last value.

### Filtering operators

Only passes on a selection of values from Observables.

`filter` only emits values which pass a test.
