## Variables

Name given to a memory location. Variables are *declared* with *type* and *name*.

Common types include `int` (integer), `String` (array of characters), `boolean`(true or false).

Whereas types such as `int`and `boolean` are primitive values, `String` is an *Object* with specified methods.

To store several values in one variable we use arrays. 

To access the value of an array we refer to the index number (beginning with 0). 

## Methods

A *method* is a block of code which is executed when called. It may return a value of a certain type, or not (type void).

Methods may take data, *parameters*, as input if the method declaration specifies so.

Methods may be called for a certain object.
