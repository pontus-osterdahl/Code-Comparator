## Multithreading

Java is a multi-threaded language which allows two or more parts of a program to run in parallel in separate threads.

Threads are specified either in extensions of the `Thread`class or by implementing a `Runnable` interface. This test will only concern the former case.

To create a new Thread an Object of an extension of the Thread class is called.

The operations of the thread are actually started from the main thread using `start()`.

To make sure that the main thread waits for another Thread to finish we may call `join()` on the thread to be waited for.
