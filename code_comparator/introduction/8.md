## Error handling

When an unrecoverable error occurs in an Observable, an `onError` notification terminates the Observable sequence.
These errors must be handled in the error callback of the Observer, typically in the `subscribe` method call.

If we do not want to stop the observable we may use the `retry` operator. 
If an error occurs before the `retry`operator in the stream it will retrying the error-generating operation. By default the retry is performed until no error occurs.
To specify a certain number of retries we pass the value to the parameter of the `retry` operator.
